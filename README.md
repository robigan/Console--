# What is the project?
This is my own take on implementing custom console objects that can do more than the default ones.

# Original idea
The original idea was for this project to facilitate console logging to both a file and stdout. Now I intend to use it to make basic UIs, provide verbosity-level based logs and facilitate the use of user input on the command line to make the application more interactible.
